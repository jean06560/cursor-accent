Do not file this until the plugin has been installed and tested on a real
Omarchy machine: the checklist below asserts things that need to be true,
not aspirational.

**Maintainer notes**
```
Recolors the system pointer to the active Omarchy theme's accent color,
automatically on every `omarchy theme set`, by compiling a Bibata cursor
through hyprcursor-util (already installed: hyprcursor is a hard Hyprland
dependency). No matugen, no new runtime dependency beyond Python (already
required, stdlib tomllib needs >=3.11).

Ships as a `service`-kind plugin with no UI of its own; the actual
recoloring is a pair of theme-set and post-boot hooks (documented Omarchy
extension points), opt-in via a bundled installer script, same as this
author's other plugins. A second opt-in script adds an optional "Style >
Cursor" point-and-click menu, since service-kind plugins have no `omarchy
bar set` equivalent to configure from. Also supports locking to one fixed
color, reverting to the system default cursor, and choosing between two
Bibata pointer shapes.

GPL-3.0-or-later, not MIT like this author's other plugins: it vendors
src/svg/config from rtgiskard/bibata_cursor (GPL-3.0-or-later, pinned
commit, no network access at runtime), documented in NOTICE.md.

No install hooks run automatically, no sudo, no network access at runtime.
